  <strong><b>Course Description: </b></strong>
          <p>Artificial intelligence is embedded in engineered systems all around us, from personalizing our movie and music experiences to assisting with tasks like autonomous parking and smart navigation. 
	     This course demystifies the building blocks and computational methods necessary to design and evaluate AI-driven systems using a scientific, data-driven approach. We will explore fundamental questions such as: 
	     How can unstructured smartphone data be transformed into meaningful features for predicting mental health? How does an email spam filter learn to differentiate between spam and important messages? 
	     How can AI models be systematically tested, refined, and validated? </p>
	
	  <p> This course introduces computational methods for AI systems, with an emphasis on applying the scientific method to AI system design. Students will learn how to formulate hypotheses, collect and preprocess data, 
	   conduct exploratory analysis, and iteratively refine AI models based on empirical evaluation. Topics include data visualization, feature engineering, and supervised and unsupervised learning. 
           Students will gain hands-on experience in R and Python, use version control tools (Git/GitHub), and leverage generative AI responsibly as a coding assistant. Additionally, the course will cover handling missing 
	   data, working with unstructured text and spatial data, and evaluating model performance through systematic experimentation. By the end of the course, students will have the skills to design, implement, and 
	   critically assess AI systems through a structured, evidence-based approach, culminating in a project-based assessment that applies these principles to real-world challenges. </p>

  <strong><b>Grading: </b></strong> 
        <!--To be announced officially on first day of class. -->
        <ul> 
          <li>Labs: 15%  </li>
          <li>Hands-On Activities: 10%</li>
          <li>Homework: 20%</li>
          <li>Mini Exams (2): 30%</li>

          <li>Class Participation: +% (extra) -- includes in-class participation + Piazza.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
  
      <p id="labs" style="padding-top: 2 em;">
        <strong><b>Labs: </b></strong>
	<p>Laboratory assignments (lab quizzes) will be posted on the course Canvas site (via the Quizzes feature) on a roughly bi-weekly basis (typically Fridays). You will generally have about two weeks to complete each lab. 
		These assignments provide hands-on exercises in R and Python programming, along with conceptual questions that supplement class material and form the foundation for course projects. Labs are open-resource: you may 
		consult textbooks, online references, and generative AI tools, provided your use fully complies with the course policy on generative AI. This includes properly endorsing, documenting, and crediting your use of any generative AI for labs.</p> 
		
		<p>While there is no time limit for these assignments, they are designed not to take more than an hour. Laboratory work is excellent preparation for exams and for applying analysis skills under real-world time constraints. <strong>Important:</strong> 
		the generative AI policy for labs is not the same as for exams. While generative AI may be used for labs in accordance with the course policy, exams must be completed without the use of generative AI or other online resources. For exams, you may only use permitted materials 
		such as your own course notes and code examples provided in class.</p>
      
  
      <p id="hands-on activities" style="padding-top: 2 em;">
        <strong><b>Hands-On Activities: </b></strong>
        <p>Hands-on activities will be used throughout the course to allow you to practice the methods covered in class, recognize opportunities to apply them in your own work, and discover their shortcomings.
        Students will submit their activity on Canvas for pass/fail credit.</p>
      </p>
  
      <p id="projects" style="padding-top: 2 em;">
        <strong><b>Homework: </b></strong>
        <p>The class will have homework assignments for some topics. While these are individual submissions, students can collaborate as long as the submitted work is their own.
           For these exercises, students will typically submit a PDF and their source code on Canvas and GitHub. 
        </p>
      </p>
  
      <p id="exams" style="padding-top: 2 em;">
        <strong><b>Exams: </b></strong>
        <p>The two exams are based on classroom material and discussions, assigned readings, and laboratory assignments. Each exam will include a closed-resource section with short-answer questions, where no 
			outside materials are allowed, and an open-resource section requiring analytical problem-solving, where you may use your own course notes and code examples but <strong> strictly prohibits the use of generative 
			AI tools or other online resources </strong>. The Midterm will cover R and conceptual material from the first half of the course, while the Final will be comprehensive with respect to conceptual material and focus on Python.</p>
  </p>
  
  <p id="course project" style="padding-top: 2 em;">
        <strong><b>Course Project: </b></strong>
        <p>The course project will be a detailed data analysis of a topic and dataset of your choosing using Python and shared and usable by others on GitHub. 
          We encourage you to do something related to your own interests and are happy to work with you in selecting a data source and defining a project. 
          You must submit your topic description and data sources for your final project at the specified date on Canvas. In your final project, you must show competence in a subset of topics discussed in the class. 
          Project deliverables are due on the last day of course. More information will be available at the midpoint in the semester. </p>

       <p id="submission" style="padding-top: 2em;">
  <strong><b>Submission and Late Submission Policy: </b></strong> 
        <p>On the day an assignment is due, you must submit an electronic copy <strong>in pdf (NOT doc or docx, etc.)</strong> along with source code on the Canvas site and pledge your submission.
        No late assignments will be accepted in this class, unless the student has procured special accommodations for warranted circumstances. <br />
        <br /></p>
        <!--Please take into account that due to the ongoing pandemic the grading policies of this class have already been relaxed to drop the lowest scored lab from the final
        grade computations, this includes an assignment with a grade of zero that was not submitted for whatever reason. -->

      <p id="illness" style="padding-top: 2em;">
  <strong><b>Illness: </b></strong> 
        <p>We try to create a safe environment, not only for our students, but also for our faculty and our staff. To that end, please stay home or in 
          your dorm room if you are ill with or are symptomatic for any communicable disease. I would rather you stay home and work something out with 
          me for making up work or taking an exam than for an illness to spread through the class. If you believe you are sick, please contact Student 
          Health for appropriate treatment or testing. </p>
      </p>
     
      </p>
      <p id="religious" style="padding-top: 2em;">
  <strong><b>Religious Accommodations: </b></strong> 
        <p>It is the University's long-standing policy and practice to reasonably accommodate students so that they do not experience an adverse academic consequence 
          when sincerely held religious beliefs or observances conflict with academic requirements.</p>
        <p>Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request to us by private message on Piazza
          as far in advance as possible. Students who have questions or concerns about academic accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs may contact 
          the University's Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights (EOCR) at <a href="mailto:UVAEOCR@virginia.edu">UVAEOCR@virginia.edu</a> or 434-924-3200.</p>
      </p>

      <p id="accessibility" style="padding-top: 2em;">
      <strong><b>Accessibility Statement: </b></strong> 
     <p>
      It is my goal to create a learning experience that is as accessible as possible. If you anticipate any issues 
      related to the format, materials, or requirements of this course, please meet with me outside of class so we 
      can explore potential options. Students with disabilities may also wish to work with the Student Disability 
      Access Center (SDAC) to discuss a range of options to removing barriers in this course, including official 
      accommodations. We are fortunate to have an SDAC advisor, Courtney MacMasters, physically located in Engineering. 
      You may email her at <a href="mailto:cmacmasters@virginia.edu>cmacmasters@virginia.edu</a> to schedule an appointment. 
      For general questions please visit the SDAC website: <a href="sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu">sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu</a>. 
      If you have already been approved for accommodations through SDAC, please send me your accommodation letter 
      and meet with me so we can develop an implementation plan together.
     </p>   
      
       <p id="integrity" style="padding-top: 2em;">
       <strong><b>Academic Integrity Statement: </b></strong> 
        <p>"The School of Engineering and Applied Science relies upon and cherishes its community of trust. 
        We firmly endorse, uphold, and embrace the University's Honor principle that students will not lie, 
        cheat, or steal, nor shall they tolerate those who do. We recognize that even one honor infraction can 
        destroy an exemplary reputation that has taken years to build. Acting in a manner consistent with the principles 
        of honor will benefit every member of the community both while enrolled in the Engineering School and in the future. 
        Students are expected to be familiar with the <a href="http://honor.virginia.edu/academic-fraud">university honor code</a>, 
        including the section on academic fraud." <br />
        <br />In summary, if assignments are individual then no two students should submit the same source code -- any overlap in source code of 
        sufficient similarity will be potentially flagged as failure to abide to the Honor Code. You can discuss, you can share resources, you can talk
        about the assignment but not share code as this would potentially incur on an honor code violation.
        Regardless of circumstances we will assume that any source code, text, or images submitted alongside reports or projects are of the authorship
        of the individual students unless otherwise explicitly stated through appropriate means. Any missing information regarding sources will be regarded potentially
        as a failure to abide by the academic integrity statement even if that was not the intent. Please be careful clearly stating
  what is your original work and what is not in all assignments.</p>
      </p>

      <p id="genai" style="padding-top: 2em;">
        <strong><b>The Use of Generative AI: </b></strong> 

         <p>
          Generative artificial intelligence tools—software that creates new text, images, computer code, audio, 
          video, and other content—have become widely available. Well-known examples include ChatGPT for text and 
          DALL•E for images. This policy governs all such tools, including those released during our semester 
          together. You may use generative AI tools on assignments in this course when I explicitly permit you to 
          do so. Otherwise, you should refrain from using such tools. </p>
          
          <p>If you do use generative AI tools on assignments in this class, you must properly document and credit the tools themselves. Cite the tool you used, following 
          the pattern for computer software given in the specified style guide. Additionally, please include a brief 
          description of how you used the tool. If you choose to use generative AI tools, please remember that they are 
          typically trained on limited datasets that may be out of date. Additionally, generative AI datasets are trained 
          on pre-existing material, including copyrighted material; therefore, relying on a generative AI tool may result 
          in plagiarism or copyright violations. </p>
          
        <p>  Finally, keep in mind that the goal of generative AI tools is to produce 
          content that seems to have been produced by a human, not to produce accurate or reliable content; therefore, 
          relying on a generative AI tool may result in your submission of inaccurate content. It is your responsibility—not 
          the tool's—to assure the quality, integrity, and accuracy of work you submit in any college course. If you use 
          generative AI tools to complete assignments in this course, in ways that I have not explicitly authorized, I reserve
          the right to apply the Honor Code to your specific case. In addition, you must be wary of unintentional plagiarism or 
          fabrication of data. Please act with integrity, for the sake of both your personal character and your academic record.
         </p>
        
        <p>In this course, the following policy dictates the acceptable use of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT
            and other similar technologies. This is a programming course and while I recognize that generative AI can
            be a tremendous learning tool, it is my expectation that these technologies do not impede you learning 
            the programming concepts taught in class.  However, these technologies can be used to enhance your
            learning experience much like one would use Stack Overflow on assignments with the exception of on exams 
            and lab quizzes which must be utilized without generative AI.

<p id="discrimination" style="padding-top: 2em;">
  <strong><b>Harrassment, Discrimination and Interpersonal Violence:</b></strong>
<p>The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning environment for all students. 
  If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can be found on the UVA Sexual Violence website 
  that describes reporting options and resources available - <a href="www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence">www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence</a>.</p>
  <p>The same resources and options for individuals who experience sexual misconduct are available for discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.  
    UVA prohibits discrimination and harassment based on age, color, disability, family medical or genetic information, gender identity or expression, 
    marital status, military status, national or ethnic origin, political affiliation, pregnancy (including childbirth and related conditions), race, 
    religion, sex, sexual orientation, veteran status. UVA policy also prohibits retaliation for reporting such behavior. </p>
<p>If you witness or are aware of someone who has experienced prohibited conduct, you are encouraged to submit a report to Just Report It 
  (<a href="justreportit.virginia.edu">justreportit.virginia.edu</a>) or contact EOCR, the office of Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights.</p>
  <p>If you would prefer to disclose such conduct to a confidential resource where what you share is not reported to the University, you can turn to 
    Counseling & Psychological Services ("CAPS") and Women's Center Counseling Staff and Confidential Advocates (for students of all genders).</p>
<p>As your professors, know that we care about you and your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources as we can. As faculty members, we are
  responsible employees, which means that we are required by University policy and by federal law to report certain kinds of conduct that you report 
  to us to the University's Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator's job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the resources and 
  support that they need, while also determining whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University community. </p>
